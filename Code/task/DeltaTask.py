#Teams are challenged to autonomously parallel park their vehicles.. The
#parking spot will be 1.8 meters by 1.1 meters. The other spots will have vehicles
#simulated with other jeeps, storage totes or something similar. Vehicle should indicate
#when it considers itself “parked.” This could be by emitting a sound or some visual
#signal. For full points teams could park their vehicles autonomously following the same
#directions as a student driver—the vehicle may pull forward parallel to the designated
#“parking space”. The vehicle must move in reverse to fit within the chalked out space
#without hitting the car parked in front of and behind the outlined space. Points
#awarded for parking with sensors, less for dead reckoning.
