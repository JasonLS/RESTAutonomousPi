Daily Autonomous Logs

October 17th, 2019 - Workshop
	We took a trip to Washtenaw Community College. We learned how to upload code to Arduino cars, powering them, and commanding them 
  to do things like moving the cars forwards, backwards, and making them turn. We also learned a bit of basic code reading, 
  what code means what, and even writing our own code.
  
	We were also introduced to the people working with square one, who gave us advice and lectures about the competition day, 
  and information regarding the autonomous team.

October 29th, 2019
  Our storage area was cleaned out and moved for our new workspace named "RHS Steamworks". We also had attempted to code our square one
  Arduino cars given to us on the college trip.

November 7th, 2019
	We were brought to our new Steamworks room , and organized the team cabinets and emptied the supply cart.

November 14th, 2019
	We were able to find the HDMI cord, but unable to find the HDMI to DVI adaptor. Therefore we were only able to do soldering work,
  and i had relabelled mini drawers.
  
Recap of November 2019
	We had begun to get everyone who was new and get situated to basic software and hardware technology like microcontrollers,
  	microcomputers, and different languages of code and other basic stuff.
Recap of December 2019
	We had decided for everyone to start python lessions so everyone had a basic understanding of how to read it.
Recap of January 2020
	Continued python lessons for the first few weeks. Then we had began working on the car, still trying to figure out how to
	get it moving and turning. We then ordered parts nessasary for getting the technological components for the car together. 
February 4th and 6th, 
	Caught up on logs and looked to linear actuator and board to control it. Also attemped to continue salder job from

	Today we visited Roseville Middle school for an outreach day. We were able to teach them the aspects of design and how autonomous
vehicles work. We had ~200 kids visit the presentations.

	Today: Karla updated logs, and preparing to film our tasks for edmodo, and also working on taking inventory. The fuse was sauldered
to the battery power wire. Ayden is learning how to use git.

-----------------------------------------------------
Please go through the Slack and see if you can find any dates relating to the following tasks that should be mentioned and documented. 
Also, ask Owen or Ayden for dates as well or more description for certain things we did.

Owen for example should know how we are steering tha car and how the motors are being controlled
Ayden should know when the car was starting to be built and when we started learning Python

-When did we start learning python
-When has the car started being built
-When did we start on the motors
-How we are going to control the motors
-recent items ordered
-decision on steering
